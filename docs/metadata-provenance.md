# Metadata provenance

Pitloom tracks the source of each metadata field in the SBOM, so questions
like "why does the SBOM say the concluded license is MIT?" or "where did
the version number come from?" have a traceable answer.

Provenance is recorded as SPDX 3 Core `Annotation` elements -- structured,
machine-readable JSON keyed by field name -- with the original human-readable
`comment` form kept alongside for back-compat. Controlled by
`[tool.pitloom.provenance]` in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pitloom.provenance]
format = "both"                    # "annotation" | "comment" | "both" (default)
detail = "minimal"                 # "minimal" (default) | "full"
preserve-source-metadata = "auto"  # "auto" (default) | "always" | "never"
```

By default (`detail = "minimal"`), a field only gets a provenance
Annotation when it adds something the native SPDX value can't already
convey -- e.g. the value was inferred or detected rather than read
verbatim. A value with a real native SPDX home (the license itself, the
package version, a dependency edge) is never restated in the Annotation;
only *how it was determined* is. Set `detail = "full"` for an exhaustive
per-field source map instead.

## Provenance examples

An `Annotation` on a package whose license was detected (not
author-declared):

```json
{
  "type": "Annotation",
  "annotationType": "other",
  "contentType": "application/json",
  "subject": "https://spdx.org/spdxdocs/mypackage-.../#Package-1",
  "statement": "{\"schema\":\"https://pitloom.dev/provenance/1\",\"fields\":{\"license\":{\"source\":\"LICENSE\",\"method\":\"licenseid_detection\"}}}"
}
```

The legacy `comment` form of the same information (present when `format`
includes `"comment"`, the default `"both"` does):

```json
{
  "type": "software_Package",
  "name": "mypackage",
  "software_packageVersion": "1.2.3",
  "comment": "Metadata provenance: version: Source: src/mypackage/__about__.py | Method: dynamic_extraction"
}
```

The provenance information shows:

- **Version**: Dynamically extracted from `src/mypackage/__about__.py`
- **License**: Detected from a `LICENSE` file, not author-declared

This transparency is crucial for:

- **Auditability**: Understanding where SBOM data comes from
- **Trust**: Verifying the accuracy of metadata, and distinguishing
  extracted facts from inferred/detected ones
- **Machine consumption**: Automated tools can parse provenance
- **Human review**: Manual inspection of data sources
